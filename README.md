# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
## Purpose and Background
In this project, I performed multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes, collected summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots, ran t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population, designed a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. This project was completed using R. 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Below is a screenshot of the linear regression model which is used to determine the coefficients of the dataset.

### Summary of Linear Regression
R generates a summary of the linear regression model which then tells us key details/information of the dataset. The linear regression model tells us how each variable impacts the topic of interest, in this case, MPG. The model tells us how each factor interacts and influences one another to make useful conclusions. After taking a look at the ~p-value~
